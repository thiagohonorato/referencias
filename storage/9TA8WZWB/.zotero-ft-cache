We study the optimal software release problem considering cost, reliability and testing efficiency. We first propose a generalized logistic testing effort function that can be used to describe the actual consumption of resources during the software development process. We then address the problem of how to decide when to stop testing and when to release software for use. In addressing the optimal release time, we consider cost and reliability factors. Moreover, we introduce the concept of testing efficiency, and describe how reliability growth models can be adjusted to incorporate this new parameter. Theoretical results are shown and numerical illustrations are presented

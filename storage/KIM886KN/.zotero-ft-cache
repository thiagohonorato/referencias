In the present time open source content management system ( CMS ) has gained a big market. Lots of varieties are available based on functionality and platform. As no CMS is best for everyone but when content management principles are concerned, two to three CMS names like Joomla, Drupal and WordPress stick in mind. These CMSs perform well in their preferred conditions. But if anyone wants informative types of website and doesn't require much functionality the question arises that out of these three CMSs which is to be preferred. As there are lot of surveys has been carried out in this area, we have tried to prove statistically by comparing their page performance criteria that which CMS is to be preferred. For doing the same we have created same pages in three CMSs to evaluate their page performance. To evaluate the page performance of these CMSs the pages had been hosted on local as well as live server. By requesting this page from client side different values of page performance criteria were recorded like page load time (PLT), page size (PS), number of request, number of CSS and JS files etc. while comparing all these parameters we could come to conclusion that which CMS should be used under what conditions.

Software quality in consumer electronics product is an important factor determining the quality of whole product. Software quality can be evaluated in various aspects depending on domain's characteristics. Therefore, it is very important to identify quality factors reflecting domain's characteristics to evaluate quality of software precisely. Currently, consumer electronics domain demands lower development cost and faster time-to-market. So, code reuse is considered as a general solution satisfying such demand. Therefore, software quality models need to be customized in view of reusability as quality goal. In this paper, we have identified some quality characteristics of ISO 9126 as critical quality factors for consumer electronics software . Also we have introduced metrics related to critical quality factors. Derived quality model can be utilized for both quality evaluation and improvement of consumer electronics software .

This paper presents an efficient anti-money laundering warning system. With the development of science and technology, money laundering is becoming more and more intelligent. Since the existing anti-money-laundering process cannot handle this kind of crime effectively, we build a system based on mainframe with SOA architectures. For one thing, as mainframes pioneer massive data processing capacity and high security, we take this advantage to handle magnanimity financial data. For another thing, we build super scalar architecture with SOA technology. Application module is presented by service and service bus can connect independent functional entities which carry out specific tasks. Therefore, the system can adapt to the variation of money laundering means.

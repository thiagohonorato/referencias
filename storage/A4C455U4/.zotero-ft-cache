This article summarizes the basic concepts of practical software measurement (PSM), explains their relationship to prior work, then describes the status of its transition into practice within the software industry. PSM is rapidly becoming the most popular approach to measurement for process management. It is based on the collective experience of a working group representing universities, industry, and government. Key elements of PSM have been documented as an international standard and incorporated into the Capability Maturity Model - integrated.

One of the major areas of software engineering, as specified in the SoftWare Engineering Body Of Knowledge, is software quality . This paper argues that software quality should be a central focus in an undergraduate computer science or software engineering curriculum, and that quality should not be viewed only as an exercise in software testing. First, we discuss the concepts and techniques that are needed to develop a high- quality software product. Then, we propose a model for viewing software quality and use the model to advocate quality activities that should be incorporated in a curriculum, addressing both product quality and process quality . We also share some of our ideas and experiences about integrating quality activities into the curriculum. Finally, we describe why an undergraduate software engineering curriculum should include at least one dedicated course in software quality . We present a detailed outline of such a course.

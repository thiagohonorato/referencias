The concern of quality of software product has been increasing in most industrial sectors. In addition, awareness of the central importance of the production process has been increasing. Process is important because industry cares about their intrinsic qualities , such as uniformity of performance across different projects and productivity, with the aim of improving time to market and reducing production costs. But processes are also important because experience has shown that they have a decisive influence on the quality of product that is, by controlling process, we can achieve better control of the required quality of products. The relationship between process and the quality of products holds especially in software production, because of the intrinsic nature of the software . In this paper we have gone through literature of software quality process and software quality models. We have studies some of important models and compare them. These models have been categorized into two i.e. Software development process models &amp, Software product models. Software process models have been applied for many years in an effort to bring order and structure development. Each of these conventional models suggests a somewhat different process flow, but all perform the same set of generic framework activities: Communication, Planning, Modeling, Construction, and deployment. Review also provides the progress in software quality models and practices that can be applied today to achieve the quality of finished product.
